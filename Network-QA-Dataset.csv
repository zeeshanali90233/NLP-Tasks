What is the purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode?,"The purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold: a) It enables the MS to receive system information from the PLMN or SNPN. b) If the MS wishes to initiate a call, it can do this by initially accessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is camped. c) If the PLMN or SNPN receives a call for the MS, it knows (in most cases) the registration area of the cell in which the MS is camped. It can then send a ""paging"" message for the MS on control channels of all the cells in the registration area. d) It enables the MS to receive cell broadcast messages.","In the general description of idle mode, when a mobile station (MS) is switched on, it seeks connection with a public land mobile network (PLMN) or a stand-alone non-public network (SNPN). This selection can be automatic or manual. The MS looks for a suitable cell within the chosen PLMN or SNPN, camps on it, and registers its presence if necessary. If coverage is lost or a more suitable cell is found, reselection occurs. If the MS loses connection to a PLMN or SNPN, it may automatically select a new one or notify the user for manual selection. Registration is not needed for MSs providing services not requiring registration. The purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode includes receiving system information, initiating calls, responding to incoming calls, and receiving cell broadcast messages. If a suitable cell is not found, the MS may attempt to camp on any available cell in a ""limited service"" state, allowing only emergency calls. Different modes such as eCall only mode or A/Gb mode have specific behaviors during idle mode. The idle mode tasks involve PLMN, SNPN, CSG, cell, location registration, CTS fixed part, and CAG selection. The subsequent section outlines requirements and technical solutions, including PLMN selection modes, forbidden areas, and handling of reject messages with specific cause values. Various timers and lists are maintained for efficient PLMN selection and service availability, with considerations for different access technologies and network scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MS then searches for a suitable cell in the same PLMN but belonging to an LA or TA not in the forbidden list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" What is the purpose of the ""forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service"" list in manual or automatic mode?","In manual or automatic mode, the ""forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service"" list is used when a message with cause value ""GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN"" or ""EPS services not allowed in this PLMN"" is received by the MS. The VPLMN causing the reject is added to this list, and the MS deletes entries when there is a successful GPRS attach, routing area update, EPS attach, tracking area update, or registration procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How does the MS handle PLMN selection when E-UTRA capability is re-enabled?,"If the MS re-enables its E-UTRA capability during PLMN selection, it memorizes the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability was disabled as PLMNs where voice service was not possible in E-UTRAN. In automatic PLMN selection, it does not consider such PLMNs for E-UTRA access technology unless no other PLMN is available.

"What are the two modes of CSG selection, and how does the Automatic mode impact the MS when selecting a cell in a PLMN?","The two modes of CSG selection are Automatic mode and Manual mode. In the Automatic mode, the MS utilizes the Allowed CSG list and the Operator CSG list. When selecting a cell in a PLMN, the MS camps on a cell only if it is either not a CSG cell or is a CSG cell with a CSG identity that is in the Allowed CSG list or the Operator CSG List.","In the context of cellular network selection and restriction, the document outlines procedures related to Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) selection and restriction, as well as Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) selection triggered by different communication scenarios. In the case of CSG selection, the Mobile Station (MS) supports both automatic and manual modes. Automatic mode relies on Allowed CSG and Operator CSG lists, ensuring the MS camps on a cell based on specified criteria. Manual mode involves user interaction, where the MS presents available CSGs, and the selection is restricted based on configuration. PLMN selection can be triggered by ProSe, V2X communication over PC5, or A2X communication over PC5. The MS follows specific steps, considering conditions like radio resources provisioned, authorized PLMNs, and network rejections, updating forbidden lists as needed. The document emphasizes limited service states for communication modes, handling registration failures, and returning to stored duplicate values in various scenarios. The detailed procedures provide a comprehensive guide for network and communication management in different contexts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Explain the conditions under which the MS shall attempt to register on a PLMN when triggered by ProSe communications, and what actions are taken if the registration fails.","When triggered by ProSe communications, the MS attempts to register on a PLMN if it meets specific conditions, such as providing radio resources for ProSe communications and being in the list of authorized PLMNs for ProSe communications. If the registration fails due to reasons like ""PLMN not allowed"" or ""EPS services not allowed,"" the MS updates the forbidden PLMNs list.

Key architectural requirements include ensuring independence of emergency services from the IP-CAN (Connectivity Access Network), supporting emergency sessions over different access networks, and allowing the detection and routing of emergency sessions even in cases where the UE (User Equipment) cannot autonomously identify an emergency. The principles emphasize the importance of prioritizing emergency sessions over non-emergency sessions, allowing for emergency sessions even when the UE lacks sufficient credentials, and supporting emergency service requests with the same authentication and security methods as non-emergency requests. The architecture accounts for scenarios where UE registration with IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) is required for emergency services and outlines procedures for emergency registration. The solution also supports emergency sessions in cases of roaming, enabling UE-initiated emergency registration in the roamed-to network. Additionally, the principles address the interaction with emergency centers (PSAPs), highlighting the capability for PSAP call-backs to UE and the provision of location information to PSAPs. Privacy considerations are taken into account, allowing users to request the non-disclosure of information to PSAPs based on session-by-session preferences and local regulations. The architecture also includes provisions for supporting various media types during emergency sessions, such as voice, GTT (Generic Text Transfer), video, and text-based instant messaging, based on local regulations and UE capabilities. The handling of location information is a critical aspect, and the principles establish guidelines for including location information in emergency session requests. The solution supports querying the IP-CAN and the LRF (Location Retrieval Function) for location information validation and retrieval. Furthermore, it ensures compliance with regional regulations and specifies the routing of emergency sessions based on the capabilities of visited networks.In summary, the IMS emergency session architecture is designed to adhere to high-level principles ensuring effective, secure, and prioritized handling of emergency calls over diverse access networks, while also addressing privacy concerns and complying with regional regulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What are the steps performed when the UE detects the request for the establishment of an emergency session?,"When the UE detects the request for the establishment of an emergency session, it performs the following steps: The UE detects the request for the establishment of an emergency session. If the UE has insufficient resources or capabilities, it may terminate ongoing communication and release reserved bearer resources. If bearer registration is required and not performed, the UE performs bearer registration to the IP-CAN. If bearer resources for IMS-related signaling transport are required, the UE reserves the resources in the IP-CAN. The UE performs a P CSCF discovery procedure to discover a suitable P CSCF for use in emergency sessions.If the UE has sufficient credentials, it initiates an IMS emergency registration, providing the IP address obtained earlier.","This document outlines procedures related to the establishment of IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) emergency sessions, focusing on high-level procedures for IMS emergency services. The procedures vary based on whether the emergency session is detectable by the user equipment (UE) or not. When the UE detects an emergency session, it performs various steps, including bearer registration, resource reservation, P CSCF (Proxy Call Session Control Function) discovery, and IMS emergency registration. If the UE cannot detect the emergency session, the session initiation request is sent to a P CSCF, and further actions depend on operator policy, access type, and whether the UE is registered in the IMS network. The document also details emergency session establishment using location retrieval functions and describes IMS registration for emergency sessions.
